# KivaShiny

```
Kiva is a non-profit crowdsourcing microfinance platform, providing banking and financial services to underserved communities around the world.Loans are also offered to borrowers who aim to create social impact in their commumities. Lenders may crowdfund the loan in increments of $25 or more. 

This Shiny app is built based on a dataset provided by Kiva for a Kaggle competition. Information included is limited to loans posted during early 2013 to mid 2017.
             
The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) published by the United Nations Human Development Program is an additional metric incorporated to the Kiva dataset. MPI uses healthy, education, and standard of living indicators to determine the degree of poverty experienced by a population.

The purpose of this Shiny app is for users who want to learn about the landscape of microfinance through Kiva and users those who would like to consider lending for the first time. This app explores various metrics such as general use of loans, loan balance, funded and unfunded amount, lender counts, etc. on a country by country basis, as well as on a global basis.
